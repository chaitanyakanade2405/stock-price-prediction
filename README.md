# Stock Price Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. The goal is to use historical stock data to forecast future stock prices, helping investors make informed decisions. It uses models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the stock prices based on various factors.

## Project Description

The Stock Price Prediction project uses machine learning algorithms, particularly **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to forecast the future stock prices of a particular company. The model is trained on historical data obtained from sources like Yahoo Finance and then used to predict future prices.

The app provides a simple interface using **Streamlit** for users to input the stock symbol and date range, and it will display a graph of predicted stock prices along with the model's forecast.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework used to build and train the LSTM model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for building neural networks, integrated with TensorFlow.
- **yfinance**: Used to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Streamlit**: Used to build an interactive web application.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to visualize the stock price predictions.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaitanyakanade2405/stock-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd stock-price-prediction
Create and activate a virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow, Keras, yfinance, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and others.

Usage
After the installation, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your default browser, where you can interact with it by providing the stock symbol and date range.

You will see a graph showing the historical stock prices along with the predicted stock prices.
