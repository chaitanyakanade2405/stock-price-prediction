# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts stock prices using historical data and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. This repository includes a trained `.keras` model and a runnable `app.py` script for making predictions.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Predicts future stock closing prices using past trends.
- Uses LSTM (deep learning) for time-series forecasting.
- Easily extendable for multiple stock datasets.
- Modular code in `app.py` for training, preprocessing, and prediction.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyakanade2405/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 How to Run
Run the prediction script:
python app.py
Make sure the required stock dataset or input handling is properly configured inside app.py. You can modify it to load a different CSV file or fetch live data.
