# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts stock prices using historical data and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. This repository includes a trained `.keras` model, a runnable `app.py` script, and a live Streamlit web app for predictions.

## 🧠 Features

- Predicts future stock closing prices using past trends.
- Uses LSTM (deep learning) for time-series forecasting.
- Easily extendable for multiple stock datasets.
- Web-based UI using Streamlit.
- Modular code in `app.py` for training, preprocessing, and prediction.
